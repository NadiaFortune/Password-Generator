# Password-Generator

## **Description**

I created a simple random password generator that would provide a randomly-generated password of between 8 and 128 characters.

The desired outcome was to allow for the following to take place:

-The user could choose the length of the password
-The user could choose to include lower case letters
-The user could choose to include upper case letters
-The user could choose to include special characters
-The user could choose to include numbers

Javascript functions were applied to produce the random password of the length chosen.

## **Installation**

The application runs within the window and is initiated when the user clicks the 'Generate Password' button.


## **Usage**

N/A

## **Credits**

The following resources were used to research the coding funcionality for the successful deployment in the console: YouTube, w3schools, and MDN.

I did not use a tutor guidance session for this challenge.
