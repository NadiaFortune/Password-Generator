# Password-Generator

## **Description**

I created a simple password generator that would provide a randomly-generated password of between 8 and 128 characters.

The desired outcome was to allow for the following to take place:

-The user could choose the length of the password;  
-The user could choose to include lower case letters;  
-The user could choose to include upper case letters;  
-The user could choose to include special characters;  
-The user could choose to include numbers  

Javascript functions were applied to produce the random password of the chosen length.

## **Credits**

The following resources were used to research the coding funcionality for the successful deployment in the console: YouTube, w3schools, and MDN.

I did not use a tutor guidance session for this challenge.
